Hey there 👋 I'm TaskBot. I'm here to help you create and manage tasks in Slack.<br>
There are two ways to quickly create tasks:<br />
<b>1️⃣ Use the <code>/task</code> command</b>. Type <code>/task</code> followed by a short description of your tasks and I'll ask for a due date (if applicable). Try it out by using the <code>/task</code> command in this channel.<br />
<b>2️⃣ Use the _Create a Task_ action.</b> If you want to create a task from a message, select <code>Create a Task</code> in a message's context menu. Try it out by selecting the _Create a Task_ action for this message (shown below).<br />

➕ To start tracking your team's tasks, <b>add me to a channel</b> and I'll introduce myself. I'm usually added to a team or project channel. Type <code>/invite @TaskBot</code> from the channel or pick a channel on the right.<br />
